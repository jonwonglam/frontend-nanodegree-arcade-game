Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

[Stampede](https://github.com/jonwonglam/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) is a Frogger Clone built during the [Udacity Front-End Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) course. You play as a princess who's land has been overrun by stampeding bugs. You must escape your land and get points each time you make it to the ocean without being crushed. What happened to everyone else? Who knows...

# Quickstart

Play via [Github pages](https://jonwonglam.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/.), download the repo zip, or clone using:

`git clone https://github.com/jonwonglam/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git`

# Gameplay
The rules are simple:
* Get points by getting your character to the water without getting hit by a bug or running out of time.
* When you get to the other side you get 1000 points plus 3 additional seconds.
* Being hit by a bug brings your points back down to 0.
* The bugs move faster the more points you have.

#### Controls
Left/Right/Up/Down arrows move the character around.

# About the Game
Stampede was created using Javascript coupled with HTML5's canvas feature. Udacity provided [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) that included sprites, a basic game engine, and the level design.

#### Goal
The goal of this project was to practice using the Pseudoclassical pattern to create classes in Javascript. The classes in this game include the player and enemy objects.

#### Issues
Currently the game doesn't work on mobile as touch is not supported. This is something I'd like to work on in the future.
